### Abstract
Vision-based robotic inspection has become pivotal in aerospace research, particularly in the domain of maintenance. This sophisticated approach seamlessly integrates computer vision and advanced control methods, enhancing the accuracy of robotic manipulators for intricate tasks. Departing from traditional fixed movement patterns, vision-based robotic inspection empowers robots to make intelligent decisions in real-time based on images. Collaborations among experts in computer vision, control systems, and aerospace engineering yield algorithms that enable robots to interpret camera and sensor data. Consequently, robotic manipulators attain the capability to autonomously conduct inspections with remarkable precision. In aerospace research, vision-based robotic inspection finds application in automating critical tasks, exemplified by the examination of aerostructures. Robotic manipulators integrated with this technology can efficiently scrutinize various components, identifying deviations from ideal measurements by collecting data about ground truth. Ongoing research focuses on implementing new algorithms or refining existing algorithms to accommodate variations in component shapes, diverse lighting conditions, and real-world scenarios. An illustrative application of vision-based inspection lies in the inspection of countersink holes' depth for the B787 vertical tail spar, shown in the figure. Developed by ARIC and currently undergoing qualification by STRATA and Boeing, this specific application employs advanced

vision-based robotic inspection techniques. The system ensures precise measurement and assessment of countersink holes, contributing to the overall quality control of critical components. This example underscores the practical impact of vision-based robotic inspection in the aerospace industry, showcasing its potential to enhance the quality assurance and efficiency of critical components during manufacturing and maintenance phases. Collaborative efforts aim to advance technology, contributing to the evolution of aerospace inspection practices. It's worth noting that this project is part of a collaboration between the Advanced Research & Innovation Center (ARIC) and STRATA R&D. This joint effort aims to develop advanced vision-based capabilities for robots, translating the potential of vision-based robotic inspection into practical applications that benefit industries. Through this collaboration, the project seeks to bring vision-based robotic inspection closer to real-world deployment, ultimately revolutionizing aerospace inspections
